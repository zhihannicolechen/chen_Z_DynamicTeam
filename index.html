        <h3>Designer & Developer</h3>
        <p>
          Student of the interactive Media design program, responsible for the graphic design and code of the website, With my interest in website design, I chose this major and am gradually learning more knowledge. Hope to enhance my design awareness and website coding basics through the opportunity to study at school.<br>This website is designed to promote the beers from Gas-X and Coors collaboration. This beer can not only bring you enjoyment on your taste buds, but also relieve your stomach discomfort, so that beer is no longer a burden on you, and you can really enjoy the happiness it brings. Gas-X beer is also available in a variety of flavors for you to choose from.

        <h3>Emotional Support</h3>
        <p>
          Cute animals on the Internet, through these small animals, designers can relax their minds and double their work efficiency. But the downside is the lack of self-control viewing too many pet photos leads to procrastination.
